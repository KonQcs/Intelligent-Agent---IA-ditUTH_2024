# Intelligent-Agent---IA-ditUTH_2024
Codes that I created as part of the course Intelligent Agents while I was studying at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the University of Thessaly.

In this repository there are the codes that I developed in the context of the course Intelligent Agents.

More specifically, I had to implement three projects with the topics Bandit Problem, Grid World and MonteCarlo Exploring Starts respectively.

Of course, it does not mean that the codes below are the optimal solutions, the goal is to show the work that I have done.
